# react todo list app

This app is a small todo list program that allows a user to add todos, toggle them as complete/incomplete, and delete them from the list. When there are no todo items present, a string of "No todos" will appear in place of a list of todos. The app utilizes the useEffect React Hook to persist todo items in local storage and the useState React Hook to load todo items from local storage. The purpose of this app is to explore React concepts including custom components, hooks, props, and broadly how to write and format React code.   

# Running The App

To run this app in your local, clone down the repository. cd into react-todo-list-app. Run the command npm run dev. The app will start on a localhost, simply copy and paste this address into your browser. Happy fiddling with the todo list app!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
